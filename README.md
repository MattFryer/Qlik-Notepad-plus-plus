# Qlik Language Definition for Notepad++

The Qlik Custom Language Definition for Notepad++ gives basic syntax highlighting, auto-completion and code tool-tips when working with QlikView and Qlik Sense script files in Notepad++.

The syntax highlighting that is provided is limited to the capabilities of Notepad++ Custom Language Definitions and Auto-Completion files, and is an approximation of what you would get in Qlik's Edit Script dialog. It currently supports the following features:

* Highlighting of all current (v11.20) functions 
* Highlighting of all current (v11.20) keywords and statements 
* Highlighting of line comments (//) and block comments (/* */) 
* Folding of comments and code blocks including IF, SWITCH, FOR, DO and SUB statements 
* Auto-completion of all current functions, keywords and statements 
* Code tool tips for most commonly used functions
* Subroutines, qualify and unqaulify statements, table loads, info loads, mapping loads and store statements all identified within the function list.

If you find any keywords or functions missing then please let me know by reporting an issue and I'll add them to the next release. Support may also be added for subroutines within Qlik code libraries. If you'd like me to add support for your library, again please contact me.

## How To Use
If you open a .qvs file, Notepad++ will automatically identify it as a Qlik script file and apply the language definition for you. If you are creating a new file or using a different file extension then you'll need to change the language using the menu Language -> Qlik.

When typing, Notepad++ will suggest keywords and function to complete what you started to type. When you type a function name followed by the opening bracket (, where possible Notepad++ will display a tool tip showing a description of the function and the correct syntax.

To view the function list panel, select View -> Function List from the menu bar. The function list will identify many statements within the Qlik script file.

To enable auto-completion, select Settings -> Preferences... from the menu bar. Select Auto-Completion from the list on the left and then ensure the options are set as follows:

The options under Auto-Insert are optional and enable auto insertion of closing brackets and quotes are automatically entered when an opening bracket or quote is typed.
